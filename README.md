# Cross-Road-Game
Idea taken from Udemy course "100 days of code" from Angela Yu.

The code is 100% of my own. I only followed the way the teacher structured the project.

Cross-Road Game developed in python using Turtle module. 
Instructions:
To use "up key" to move the turthe.
Cars will be generated randomly.
As you level up the cars move faster.
